ML TECHNICS IN SALES AND MARKETING<br/>
<br/>
In this section I am focusing on data anlysis and machine learning technics, which can be used in sales <br/>
and marketing management.<br/>
<br/>
1.) GROCERY MARKET BASKET ANALYSIS<br/>
<br/>
In this project I am focusing on how market basket analysis improve 4P strategies. I determine ASSOCIATION<br/>
I determine ASSOCIATION rules, ANTICEDENT AND CONSEQUENT elements, and calculate SUPPORT, CONFIDENCE and LIFT  <br/>
indicators in two different ways, which provide useful information for the companies to plan their marketing  <br/>
strategy in fields like:
<br/>
- Product placement<br/>
- Promotional discount<br/>
- POS (point of sales) advertisement <br/>
- Product boundling<br/>
- ANTICEDENT AND CONSEQUENT products can be combined to a new product<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
2.) E-COMMERCE analysis project. In this project I am working with a huge retail data trying out various technics  <br/>
to explore useful connections and relations among the data including:<br/>
<br/>
- Choropleth to check the geographical distribution of the purchases <br/>
- Kmeans clustering to define customer clusters on the basis of how many invoices (say one invoice means one shopping) one customer has and what are the total value of the invoices per customer.<br/>
- Text mining technics to find product categories<br/>
- Market basket anylsis to get to know the buying patterns of the customers and promote cross selling of various products<br/>
