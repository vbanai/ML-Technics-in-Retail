ML TECHNICS IN THE RETAIL INDUSTRY<br/>
<br/>
In this section I am focusing on data anlysis and machine learning technics, which can be used in the retail industry.<br/>
<br/>
In the GROCERY MARKET BASKET analysis project I determine ASSOCIATION rules, ANTICEDENT AND CONSEQUENT  <br/>
elements, and calculate SUPPORT, CONFIDENCE and LIFT indicators in two different ways, which provide useful <br/>
 information for the companies to plan their marketing strategy in fields like: <br/>
<br/>
    Product placement<br/>
    Promotional discount<br/>
    POS (point of sales) advertisement <br/>
    Product boundling<br/>
    ANTICEDENT AND CONSEQUENT products can be combined to a new product<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
In the E-COMMERCE analysis project I am working with a huge retail data trying out various technics to explore <br/>
useful connections and relations among the data including "Choropleth" to check the geographical <br/>
distribution of the purchases, "Tokenizer" to find frequent word formation, performing market basket<br/>
analysis, trying to use unsupervised k-means technic to cluster the data.
